📝 Project Summary

This project is about creating a Sports Skill Tracking App for an individual sport (Badminton as the main example). The app will allow athletes—like a 9-year-old boy who dreams of becoming a professional player—to track their skills, physical performance, training progress, and achievements over time.

The goal is to design and develop a motivating, easy-to-use, and insightful sports companion app that combines performance monitoring, data visualization, and storytelling to help players decide whether they should pursue the sport more seriously.

🎯 Objectives

Build a frontend sports tracking app as an individual project.

Design a user-friendly interface that motivates young athletes.

Implement performance tracking over multiple timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

Allow storage and visualization of player profile, training details, and competition results.

Provide insights, rankings, and achievements in a simple dashboard view.
